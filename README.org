My programming exercises

- Exercism 

- Project Euler

and other exercises and research I do occasionally.

Usually each project does a single thing, except when thats tedious to
achieve.

Sometimes I make a blog post about the project.

i also started adding makefiles, for installing deps, and running
tests uniformly for a variety of languages.
